What would the world be like if all we could eat was McDonald's? If there were no mole, no quesadillas, no tacos, nothing existed. The Mexican food you and I know would only exist, the food of the country where you're watching this video. That food wouldn't exist, it wouldn't exist in Azahara, none of that would exist, there would only be McDonald's. We'd be happy just eating McDonald's. And the food isn't bad, it's average. The quality is always the same, no matter what part of the world you're in, it's McDonald's, nothing special. But it's always missing something, isn't it? Although it lacks substance or something is missing, we don't hurt ourselves. That's what artificial intelligence is, you have to see it that way, McDonald's food. In terms of technology, code, it would be McDonald's code. Is it very good? No, is it very bad? No, but it satisfies a basic need, which is programming in this case. So we have to have crazy ideas that give us the "chile en nogada".
