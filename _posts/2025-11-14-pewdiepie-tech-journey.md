So a YouTuber PewDiePie, with a hundred subscribers, tells us. He decided to enter world 3, and not exactly the kind of person on the internet who is known for doing silly things to live off culture, the internet, playing games, more getting into that kind of thing. This guy started building his website a few months ago, up to that point, nothing we can't see. In a scenario, at the end of his video, which is 10 minutes long, which is his 10-minute bleed. Well, we haven't had money, but in your life you can do it, he's learning from another hour, 30 minutes of video, yes, he's testing. And even his idea, well, after step by step, no, the room has resources, and since you have to have resources, I'm going to make my own supercomputer, I mean, they're absolute, but it's a reasonable one, but it's his, which is a bit of a supercomputer, it has a processor, 3.3, which for those who don't need the one it has, is the branch of, let me see, that has many more for workstations and graphics cards, precisely I think it has 8 at that point in the video, 8 graphics cards for intelligence. It's not the cards from the FITA, it's that you and I can buy commercially about video cards, so the computer itself says that the cost of the magazine is a thousand dollars, and beyond the size of the computer, but it turns out that it has a lot of power to make purchases to death, and since that extreme, well, it was bought, well, at least you don't have to do anything, because there is a piece of black teinas, let's see how the computer is, what the program is, to contribute to the cure of the house, well, so far everything is fine, so that you want to use it, and then the one who uses the LMS in the place, starts to play with the LMS first, from the biggest one that is at that moment, which is like 60 billion for metrophones, like those as you feel, a case of RAM, of virran, it wasn't enough, we have more than enough for the machine, well, it has been found, which ended the greeting, it is 120 billion more in the way that I am more intelligent, and what do you think, They still have time for the machine, and the girl playing with that computer does several experiments within them, and the first is like she makes a possible artificial one, it's the pain among them, and that vote to give manual pasta, in the experiment it costs her, that in those artificial interventions when giving the knowledge that for the one who came out eliminated, they start to vote extra, critically to avoid being the gymnast, because those that the artificial one is, there I think there is a piece, but that in what aspect, has a sense of self-preservation, that it is an artificial one so that it does not want to die, and then, we can also, of those that are more toned, smaller, and they do the same race, and the second thing that happens is that hey, if we can play with this, because it is already programming, it is already clearly, it is not doing our own things, that is written, until that it is not using tools as it is if it is not, and firmly it is learning, because this is only, and it is known, the coate does not have to prove anything to anyone, it does not have to say, I don't know, they program a Gymnas, they have nothing, no, they're rich, she pays, no, she's more ill, the Friday is bad, where a pie of palla, what he does on the internet, it's worthless to him, someone who's here making videos, what he does on the internet, well, it matters, but not to him, to make millions of views of things, anyway, the point is that he doesn't ask for pal, he grabs and puts, what's it called, he doesn't ask for pal and puts his models in order to solve tasks, and to give them tools, and he realizes that within the tools, he realizes that a smaller model, what's already in a pieo too, then, I can see him and from the pieo and he had avoided the problem, it was the experiment of the video, and that is the account that if he does a rar, with a which is a retrieve, increases generate, a system that basically searches the internet, and with the special genzo, they gained a result, well, that it's much better than simply a large model, which is our tool, a combination of technologies that is quite good, the point is that Within all of this, the text community felt offended, I mean, like why, you have someone who has an army of people who are going to want to learn how to try it, because they're successful like him, well, because he has an army of people who are going to want to be like him, and on the other hand, why was it that once you used the note, it's being removed? Dude, the guy isn't going to remove you, dude, it's more likely that he would tell you to remove it, than to flirt with you, let's say, right? It's because he's a toto on the internet, it's because he's making a fool of himself, well, yes, he's a toto on the internet, but that doesn't make us any less.
