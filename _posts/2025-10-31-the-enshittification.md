I've been considering this concept, institutionalization or my "enshittification"? We're talking about me. The concept isn't new, but I'm referring to Cory Doctor O, it's not terribly strange, but it's curious, it seemed to come from a mix of Entreale, Exintec, and seeing the juice in this Wikipedia photo that I didn't understand. The point is that "enshittification" talks about how all products tend to degrade in quality over time. And why does this happen? Because once they have a completely captive market, they no longer care if the product improves. That's why, in cases like the recent Debe de A, it happens that, in the application, but since we are all captive to Debe de A, it doesn't matter, it won't lose customers. Another case, another example, would be Facebook. Remember when Facebook was a fun place to connect with friends, where I interacted with real people? Now it's just pure advertising. And if I'm talking about platforms, you name them all, once they dominate the market they can do whatever they want. There won't be one that's the best. I'll leave it to you in the comments to tell me what your worst experience with the app has been. Tell me, I'll see you there.
