You probably have a box of CDs somewhere. Maybe DVDs of movies you love. Perhaps video games from your childhood sitting on a shelf. You haven't touched them in years because, well, streaming exists now. Spotify has millions of songs. Netflix has thousands of shows. Your entertainment is safe in the cloud, right?

Wrong. Your media is dying. All of it. And the companies you trust to keep it alive are more likely to delete it than preserve it.

## The Physics of Forgetting

Let's start with the hard truth: nothing lasts forever. Every storage medium has a lifespan, and most are shorter than you think.

**Optical discs**—CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays—are the most fragile. Discs manufactured before 2000 are already reaching their expiration date. The plastic substrate degrades. The reflective aluminum layer oxidizes and peels away. Bit rot sets in. That album you bought in 1995 might not play anymore. If you can still read it, you're lucky, but luck runs out.

**Hard drives** aren't much better. Traditional HDDs contain moving parts that wear down. The magnetic coating that stores your data slowly degrades. Expect 3-5 years of reliable service, maybe 10 if you're careful. After that, you're gambling.

**Solid-state drives** seem safer with no moving parts, but they have their own Achilles heel: write endurance. Every time you save data, you slightly damage the memory cells. SSDs can last 5-10 years under normal use, but they're not immortal archives. They're temporary storage with a countdown timer.

Even **magnetic tape**, the gold standard for long-term archival storage, only lasts 10-30 years. The most ambitious preservation projects, like the GitHub Arctic Code Vault designed to last 1,000 years, rely on specialized materials and cold storage—data kept in stable, low-activity environments. Your closet doesn't qualify.

The CD on your shelf isn't a permanent record. It's a time bomb.

## The Corporate Problem

But surely, you think, the streaming services have backups. If my DVD dies, I can just watch it on Netflix. If my CD scratches, Spotify still has the album.

This assumption contains two fatal flaws.

First, streaming services don't preserve everything. They preserve what makes money. When a licensing agreement expires, content disappears overnight. Albums vanish from Spotify. Movies leave Netflix. Shows you've watched for years simply cease to exist on the platform. If no company profits from hosting a particular piece of media, that media dies.

Second, corporations don't care about preservation. They care about quarterly earnings. Your favorite album from the 90s isn't getting remastered in high resolution because the record label doesn't see a market for it. Obscure films aren't being restored because restoration costs more than the revenue they'd generate. When the economics don't work, the content is abandoned.

This is where piracy has ironically become the world's most effective preservation system. Communities of archivists, working outside the law, have saved countless pieces of "lost media" that corporations discarded. When the official channels fail, illegal ones become the only hope for survival. That's a damning indictment of our entertainment infrastructure.

Your childhood memories, your favorite albums, the shows that shaped you—they're stored on decaying plastic and maintained by companies that would delete them tomorrow if it saved a dollar.

## The Crisis Is Now

If you own CDs from the 1980s, 1990s, or early 2000s, understand this: they are actively dying. Disc rot isn't theoretical. It's happening now, to your collection, while you read this. The organic dyes in recordable discs degrade faster than factory-pressed ones. Even professionally manufactured discs from the CD's golden age are reaching their structural limits.

DVDs and Blu-rays fare slightly better, but not by much. The materials are similar. The decay processes are identical. If you haven't checked your optical media recently, you might already have unreadable discs and not know it.

This isn't a future problem. This is happening today.

## What You Should Do Right Now

The good news: you can fight back. The solution isn't complicated, but it requires action. Here's your preservation checklist:

**Rip everything immediately.**
- Convert audio CDs to FLAC format. It preserves the original quality perfectly and is 100% legal for personal use.
- Backup DVDs and Blu-rays to HEVC (H.265) files. The compression is excellent, and the quality remains high.
- Don't wait for "someday." Your discs are degrading now.

**Follow the 3-2-1 rule.**
- Keep 3 copies of your data.
- Store them on 2 different types of media (not just multiple hard drives).
- Keep 1 copy offsite or in cold storage (An external hard drive that stays powered off most of the time).

**Consider a home media server (optional but recommended).**
- Tools like Plex or Jellyfin let you access your ripped collection from any device.
- You maintain full control. No licensing agreements. No surprise removals.
- Your media, your rules.

## The Real Cost

I know doing all this will consume time, effort, and money, but consider this: Losing media is more than simple and vain entertainment; it’s a memory, it’s culture. It's who you are.

Big corporations won't preserve it for you. They'll delete it when the profits dry up. The cloud is someone else's computer, and they can pull the plug anytime they want.

Only you can ensure that the content you value survives. Start ripping tonight.
