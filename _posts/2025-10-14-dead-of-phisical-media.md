Is it worth buying if it says 25? I'm telling you yes, and I'll explain why. For many, the format is said to be the best, and while that's true, it doesn't apply in every case. First of all, because not all albums you'll find today are available in high resolution. You have to consider that there are artists whose albums were recorded 20 or 30 years ago; they're no longer interested in remastering or reselling all their albums. A big hit, but not all their albums from previous years. So, if you're lucky enough to have one of these discs at home and you can make a personal rip, which is legal, you'll have 100% control over the format and the quality of the audio it contains. And while it's not the highest quality, it's the best option you can have, and that's what makes the difference. So, if someone tells you it's not worth it, don't waste your money on your purchase.

# That Captain Obvious, telling us that nothing lasts forever

If we upload it to the internet, it's forever. Let's see. The reality is that if something doesn't go viral, isn't distributed, and isn't stored on multiple sources, it might not last forever. Let's look at current storage media. All of them start to show their age after a certain date. For example, this lasts 5 years, even with some improvement. Optical media lasts 10 to 20 years. Magnetic tape, in the form of shielding, lasts 10 to 30 years; it's already quite solid. And all the best of these things, I don't know why, but they're usually stored in the cold. Why? Because they're not being read. That's why in 2020 this came out, the Gid-Hob Arctic Compote, which is basically going to store the world's code in the Arctic, and this can last for a thousand years. And how do they achieve a thousand years? In films and images. So, nothing lasts forever.

# We are reaching the end of the lifespan of many disks that once

This is going to disappear. And beyond streaming platforms where there's a community that can listen to them on any device, the technical aspect is that CDs are reaching the end of their useful life, and many people who bought them back in the 2000s or earlier are starting to see their quality decline. The plastic starts to degrade, the film on the back of the disc starts to peel, and that's when data loss occurs in sections. So what are we going to do? Well, get a CD player. In my case, it's this old one, but it works. And it makes a copy. To save the digital copy, you save it on a medium you control. It can still be lost, it's not impossible, it's not a hard and fast rule, but at least you have a digital copy that preserves this version, and that's the best thing you can do. In this case, I have this one, and I'll say it because I'm broke, but it's what I had on hand. I have a copy.
