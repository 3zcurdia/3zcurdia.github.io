When I started my career as a developer, I was lucky to be part of a vibrant community that offered a wealth of resources for beginners. Resources like RailsCasts by Ryan Bates and Rails for Zombies by Code School were incredibly helpful in learning the ropes. However, as I progressed in my career, I noticed that the community was changing. There were fewer resources available for beginners, and the updates to the framework were becoming increasingly complex.

Take the asset pipeline, for example. Sprockets used to be the default tool for managing assets in Rails, which was easy to understand and use. But with the switch to Webpacker, things got more advanced but less beginner-friendly, leaving developers to turn to Stack Overflow to figure things out. Now, with the latest release of Rails 7, the default tool has changed again, allowing the developers to select between importmaps, esbuild, webpacker, or rollup. This is a great improvement in flexibility, but since there are a lot of options, it can be overwhelming for beginners.

On the other hand, there's a new trend in the web development world that involves sending HTML over the wire with tools like Hotwire in the Rails scene and Live View in the Phoenix scene. This approach brings us back to the days when we simply sent simple HTML responses, but with the main difference being that the interactivity is done with the help of modern JavaScript frameworks. However, while the Hotwire solution is an excellent addition to the Rails framework, the core team decided to promote it as an independent solution, resulting in a lack of clear documentation on how to use it in a Rails application with their respective gems. Even though Hotwire can be used outside the Rails scope, in most cases, the only place where is implemented is within Rails, making it challenging to learn and use. In contrast, the Phoenix Live View documentation is very well written and integrated within the Phoenix framework, making it easy to learn and use. Furthermore, the Phoenix community is highly active and supportive, making it a more attractive option for new developers.

Additionally, the problem of senior developers leaving Ruby in favor of other languages like Elixir, Go, Rust, and others have become a growing concern. This is something that has been on my mind for the past few years. In other communities, this may not be seen as a significant issue for the future of the technologies because the talent pool is massive, and there are always new developers to replace those who leave. However, in the Ruby community, the talent pool is relatively small, and senior developers are in high demand. If we don't take action to attract new developers, the language could be in danger of fading out, much like COBOL. Where there is a demand for senior developers, there is a need for junior developers to fill the gap. Without a steady stream of junior developers, the senior developers will eventually leave, and the language will die out. 

In the face of this situation, as a community what could we do?

- First and foremost we need to keep building software with ruby. Although it sounds obvious. The fact that ruby jobs exist today is because someone years ago decided to build a project with the language. 
- Generating content, and sharing your knowledge with beginners is a great way to attract and retain new developers, who are the future of the Ruby community. 
- Train and mentor junior developers to ensure a steady stream of new talent and prevent the senior developer gap from widening. Even when your company does not have a training program. You can always have a ruby friend!
-  Explore new ways to integrate Ruby with other technologies and frameworks. To keep the language alive we must be open to experimenting with new things with the tool we love. By doing this we might find new opportunities and use cases for Ruby that we may not have considered before.
- Get involved in your local community, yes this also sounds obvious. But most Senior developers tend to abandon their communities due to the lack of quality content for experts, but when we were just starting everything seems exciting because when we were learning. Now is our turn to share with others

Let's take action and ensure that the Ruby community thrives for years to come.

Elixir has indeed set the bar high with its comprehensive content and integrated solutions, but this should not discourage us. Instead, we should take this as an opportunity to improve and innovate. With a focus on creating better content for beginners and improving tool integration. 

I believe that by working together and investing in the growth of junior developers, we can create a vibrant and dynamic community that will keep Ruby at the forefront of technology. So let's roll up our sleeves and get to work because the future is bright for Ruby!
