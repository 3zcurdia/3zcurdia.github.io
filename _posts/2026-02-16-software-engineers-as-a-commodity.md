Engineers are reinforced over time; this message is for investors. Why? Because within a company's operating costs, the most expensive item is payroll, and engineering payroll is always more expensive than the rest because engineers are costly. So, let's cut costs and reduce the number of engineers we need. For investors, it sounds good. In fact, too good to be true. When something sounds too good to be true, it's because it's a scam. It reminds me a bit of that aunt who comes along and says, "Hey, give me a thousand pesos, invest a thousand pesos, and in a month, you'll have 2,000." It sounds more like a scam than anything else, but that's how investors are presenting this technology: it's going to transform your aunt's aunt's aunt. It reminds me a bit of that aunt who comes along and tells you, "This technology is going to transform your workforce into profits." What do you think?
