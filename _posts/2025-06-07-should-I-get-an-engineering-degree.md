The tech industry loves debating whether you need a degree. Bootcamp graduates, self-taught developers, and startup founders all claim you can skip university and go straight to coding. For some markets, that might work. But if you're in Mexico, my answer is clear: yes, you should get that engineering degree.

## The Mexican Market Reality

Mexico's tech ecosystem operates differently from Silicon Valley. Most of the market consists of agencies and nearshore companies serving US clients. These clients have specific expectations: they want to work with professionals, not teenagers.

Agencies know this. When they staff projects for American customers, they filter candidates by age and credentials. A 18-year-old React wizard won't get the same opportunities as a 23-year-old with an engineering degree. The degree signals maturity and professionalism that international clients demand.

This isn't about fairness. It's about business. Companies sell the promise of experienced professionals, and they need credentials to back that up.

## Time: The Hidden Advantage

A university program takes four to seven years (depending on the programs and your effort). That sounds like a delay, but it's actually a gift. At 18, you don't know what you don't know. The tech industry stretches far beyond React and web development, but you need time to discover that.

Those years let you explore:
- Systems programming and embedded development
- Data science and machine learning
- Security and cryptography
- Distributed systems and cloud architecture
- Project management and technical leadership

You might discover you hate frontend work but love databases. You might find your passion in robotics or DevOps. University gives you the space to sample the full menu before ordering your career.

Plus, nobody hires 18-year-olds for serious engineering roles regardless of their GitHub portfolio. Time solves that problem naturally.

## The English Imperative

Here's something bootcamps rarely teach you: your technical skills mean nothing if you can't communicate. English dominates the tech industry. Documentation, conferences, Stack Overflow, and professional communication all happen in English.

University gives you years to develop this skill properly. Take English classes. Watch talks without subtitles. Read technical documentation in its original language. By the time you graduate, you'll have the language skills that open doors to international opportunities.

Without English, you cap your career at local companies. With it, the entire global market becomes available.

## Network: Your First Job and Lifelong Friends

Your first job will likely come from someone you met in college. Maybe a professor recommends you. Maybe a classmate's company is hiring. Maybe someone you studied with starts a startup and needs technical co-founders.

Beyond professional connections, university surrounds you with peers who share your interests. You'll find friends who geek out over the same technologies, who stay up late debugging code with you, who understand the satisfaction of a clean architecture. These friendships last decades and often evolve into business partnerships.

Don't underestimate the value of having friends who speak your language—technically and literally.

## Fundamentals Over Frameworks

The tech industry moves fast. React might dominate today, but tomorrow brings something new. If you only know specific tools, you become obsolete when those tools fade.

University focuses on fundamentals:
- Algorithms and data structures
- Computer architecture and operating systems
- Mathematics and logic
- Software engineering principles
- Database theory and design

These foundations don't change. They let you adapt to any new technology because you understand how computers actually work. You're not memorizing framework syntax; you're learning to think like an engineer.

Building a career on fundamentals is like building a house on bedrock. Building on trendy technologies alone is building on sand.

## Conclusion

Should you get an engineering degree? Yes—but not because there's no other path into tech. Plenty of successful developers skipped university.

Study because it gives you time to grow and explore. Because it provides credentials that open doors in the Mexican market. Because it builds a network that will support your entire career. Because it teaches you fundamentals that outlast any framework.

The degree isn't just a piece of paper. It's four to seven years of structured growth, exposure to possibilities you didn't know existed, and relationships that will shape your professional life.

In the long run, that investment pays dividends that no bootcamp or self-study path can match.
