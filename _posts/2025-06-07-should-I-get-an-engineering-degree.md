You should study a university degree, as these guys say, right? Or what do you think? At least for Mexico, my opinion is yes, because university will give you two things. The first is time. If you're 7 years old, you're pretty clueless. Repeat after me: I don't know everything. And therefore, many companies will check your age and won't contact you; they won't need you. And since you have time, you can explore the whole universe of alternatives and options you have in the tech world. It's not all about React development, it's not all about the website. Good luck. And there's an extra benefit that university gives you: contacts. You'll make friends, and your friends will connect you with companies. And you'll build a professional network; you'll build it up, and that's something the university helps with too.
